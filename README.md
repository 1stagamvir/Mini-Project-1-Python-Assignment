This repository contains solutions to a comprehensive Python programming assignment covering fundamental operations with lists, dictionaries, sets, file handling, and performance analysis.

📋 Assignment Overview
The assignment covers the following key Python concepts:

List operations (adding, removing, sorting, searching)

Dictionary manipulations

Set operations (union, intersection, difference)

Random string and number generation

Prime number identification

File input/output operations

Time complexity analysis

Data visualization with matplotlib

Student marks analysis

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-assignment.git
cd python-assignment
Install dependencies (if any):

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run individual question files:

bash
python Q1_list_operations.py
python Q2_dictionary_operations.py
# ... and so on for other files
🧩 Question Highlights
Core Data Structures
Lists: Comprehensive operations including sorting, searching, and element manipulation

Dictionaries: Key-value pair operations and file serialization

Sets: Mathematical set operations and membership testing

File Operations
Writing dictionary contents to file

Saving random strings and prime numbers to files

Storing element lengths from lists

Advanced Features
Program execution time measurement

Sorting performance analysis with visualization

Student marks analysis with average calculations

📊 Sample Outputs
Output files will be generated in the outputs/ directory:

dictionary_output.txt: Key-value pairs from dictionary

list_lengths.txt: List elements with their lengths

random_strings.txt: 100 random strings

primes_600_800.txt: Prime numbers between 600-800

📝 Notes
For Q12 (sorting analysis), matplotlib is required to display the graph.

All solutions use Python standard libraries except Q12 which requires matplotlib.

Random number generation uses Python's random module.
